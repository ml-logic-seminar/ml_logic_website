## MapleSAT
[MapleSAT](https://sites.google.com/a/gsd.uwaterloo.ca/maplesat/){:target="_blank"} series of SAT solvers is a family of conflict-driven clause-learning SAT solvers outfitted with machine learning-based heuristics. 

## Z3 String Solver
[Z3 String solver](https://sites.google.com/site/z3strsolver/getting-started){:target="_blank"} is a constraint solver for the quantifier-free theory of string equations, the regular-expression membership predicates, and linear arithmetic over the length functions. Z3 string solver is implemented as a string theory plug-in of the powerful Z3 SMT solver.

## MapleCrypt
[MapleCrypt](https://sites.google.com/view/crypto-sat/home?authuser=0){:target="_blank"} line of research focuses on tailoring the internals of SAT solvers to cryptographic problems as well as applying machine learning for splitting heuristics in parallel SAT solvers.

## MathCheck
[MathCheck](https://uwaterloo.ca/mathcheck/){:target="_blank"} is a combination of the computer algebra system (CAS) SAGE with a SAT Solver. Users can define predicates in the language of the CAS which can be finitely verified in a loop by the SAT solver, analogous to basic SMT approaches.

## Attack Resistant Security Defense Mechanims
[Attack resistance](https://sites.google.com/site/attackresistant/){:target="_blank"} is a formal approach aimed at analyzing security defense mechanisms (e.g., ASLR, ISR,...) and cryptographic obfuscation methods with the goal of ascertaining whether they are secure.
