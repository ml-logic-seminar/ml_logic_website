## Waterloo ML + Logic Online Colloquium
We are currently organizing the Waterloo Machine Learning (ML) + Logic Online Colloquium which is sponsored by the [Waterloo Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://uwaterloo.ca/artificial-intelligence-institute/){:target="_blank"} and the [Waterloo Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute](https://uwaterloo.ca/cybersecurity-privacy-institute/){:target="_blank"}. As part of this, we host frequent talks by top researchers from around the world via WebEx on research topics listed above. Please visit our [website](https://ml-logic-seminar.github.io/){:target="_blank"} for more information.
