# Overview of Research
- Testing, Analysis, Verification, Security and Privacy (TAVSP) of machine learning (ML) systems
- ML-based heuristics for solvers and provers
- ML for math and physics
- NeuroSymbolic AI

We are currently organizing the Waterloo Machine Learning (ML) + Logic Online Colloquium - where we host talks by top researchers from around the world via WebEx on topics at the intersection of ML and logic broadly, with special focus on Testing, Analysis, Verification, Security, Privacy (TAVSP) of ML systems, as well as the use of ML in mathematical logic solvers/provers and NeuroSymbolic AI.
