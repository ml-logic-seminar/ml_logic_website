# Logic + Machine Learning


## Overview
Our work at the intersection of logic + machine learning looks to leverage advances in the field of formal logic to improve training or testing of machine learning.


## Projects
Currently, we have three projects that leverage logic to machine learning:
1. [Logic Guided Machine Learning(LGML)](https://ml-logic-seminar.github.io/ml_logic_website/lgml.html){:target="_blank"}
2. [xAI-GAN: Enhancing Generative Adversarial Networks via Explainable AI Systems](https://ml-logic-seminar.github.io/ml_logic_website/xAIGAN.html){:target="_blank"}
3. [Logic Guided Genetic Algorithms (LGGA)](https://dhananjayashok.github.io/LGGA/){:target="_blank"}


## Potential Applications
Leveraging logic to improve machine learning can provide many benefits, such as:
- Reducing the amount of data required by the machine learning model to successfully train.
- Verifying whether the machine learning model adheres to certain properties.
- Augmenting reasoning capability of machine learning models in order to perform end-to-end learning.
